# CryptoTicker 

Allows you to enter a cryptos ticker symbol, and retrieve its real time stats using Krakens API

Krakens data is weird, and the volume as well as the transaction #'s are incredibly low. My assumption is this is due to the info being specific to Krakens servers, and not entire market data

If a ticker symbol doesnt work, its due to the symbol being incorrect or krakens API not supporting it

This is my first live project using Javascript with an API. 
  LIkely inefficient JS
  Hardly responsive for mobile
  

Just learning to use API's
